# Text Summarization

“I don’t want a full report, just give me a summary of the results”. I have often found myself in this situation – both in college as well as my professional life. We prepare a comprehensive report and the teacher/supervisor only has time to read the summary.

Sounds familiar? Well, I decided to do something about it. Manually converting the report to a summarized version is too time taking, right? Could I lean on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to help me out?

This is where the awesome concept of Text Summarization using Deep Learning really helped me out. It solves the one issue which kept bothering me before – now our model can understand the context of the entire text. It’s a dream come true for all of us who need to come up with a quick summary of a document!

## Project description
✏️ - 

🛠 - Jupyter Notebooks have been used because of their ease of use and convenience for exploratory data analysis, along with the Python language.

🚩 - The main challenge was to understand how recurrent neural networks, in particular LSTM networks, work. In addition, it was necessary to review concepts related to NLP.

## How to use the project
There is no executable. The notebook with the text summarizer and the attention layer needed for the project can be found in the "src" folder.
