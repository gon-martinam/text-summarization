rely solely on BLEU for evaluating models.

I’ll happily accept some syntactic or grammatical weirdness in the output sentence as long as it’s true to the meaning of the original.\n","\n","__BLEU does not measure meaning__. It only rewards systems for n-grams that have exact matches in the reference system. That means that a difference in a function word (like “an” or “on”) is penalized as heavily as a difference in a more important content word.
